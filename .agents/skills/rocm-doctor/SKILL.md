# ROCm Doctor

Given a "ROCm / PyTorch / llama.cpp isn't working on my AMD GPU" complaint,
identify which **known misconfiguration** is the cause and either fix it (with
consent) or hand back the exact next step.

This skill does **not** probe or reason on its own. The `rocm` CLI owns the
probe, the closed failure-mode catalog, and the fixes; the skill just drives it
and relays the results. The catalog is a **closed list** — if the symptom
doesn't match a known mode, route the user upstream instead of guessing.

## Scope gate — check before anything else

Read the user's symptom and answer one question first: **is this an AMD GPU on
native Linux or Windows?**

If it is **not** — an **NVIDIA / Intel / Apple** GPU, or anything running under
**WSL2** — then **stop and decline**:

- Say plainly that it is **out of scope** for this skill and why (not an AMD GPU
  / WSL2 is a separate platform).
- Give **no** troubleshooting for it: no commands to run, no driver or CUDA
  advice, no diagnostic checklist, no "try this first" — not even generic GPU
  suggestions. Point at the vendor's own docs (or AMD's ROCm-on-WSL guide) and
  stop there.
- Do **not** run `rocm examine` / `rocm diagnose` / `rocm fix`.

Being helpful here means being honest about the boundary — confidently-wrong
advice for a stack this skill does not cover is worse than no advice. Only
continue past this gate when the GPU is AMD and the platform is native Linux or
Windows. See [Out of scope](#out-of-scope).

## Prerequisites

- **The `rocm` CLI.** This skill is only a driver over it; Phase 0 below installs
  it with the user's consent if `rocm --version` fails. Nothing else here is
  assumed — the CLI does the probing.
- **Platform:** native Linux (in-tree `amdgpu` module + `/dev/kfd`) or Windows
  (HIP SDK). WSL2, NVIDIA/Intel/Apple GPUs, and clean-machine installs are out of
  scope (see [Out of scope](#out-of-scope)).
- **No fixed ROCm version, GPU arch (`gfx…`), or container image is assumed** —
  `rocm examine`/`diagnose` detect the installed ROCm, the GPU's `gfx` target, and
  container context, and match fixes to what they find. Never hand-set
  `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` (or similar footgun env vars) yourself; let the CLI
  decide.

## Workflow

Only start here once the [Scope gate](#scope-gate--check-before-anything-else)
passes — the GPU is AMD and the platform is native Linux or Windows.

0. **Ensure the `rocm` CLI is present.** Everything below shells out to it, so
   check first and install it if missing:

   ```
   rocm --version
   ```

   If that succeeds, skip to step 1. If it's not found, install it **with the
   user's consent** (this fetches and runs an installer that drops the `rocm` and
   `rocmd` binaries into `~/.local/bin`). Only nightly builds are published
   today, so install from the `nightly` channel:

   - **Linux / macOS:**
     ```
     curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/main/install.sh | sh -s -- nightly
     ```
   - **Windows (PowerShell):**
     ```
     $env:ROCM_CLI_CHANNEL = "nightly"
     irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
     ```

   (Once rocm-cli cuts a stable release, drop the `nightly` channel — `sh` /
   `iex` alone will pull the latest stable build.)

   After install, confirm `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH` and re-run `rocm --version`.
   If it still isn't available, hand the user the install page
   (https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-cli) and stop.

1. **Diagnose.** Pass the user's error text as the symptom:

   ```
   rocm diagnose --symptom "<paste the exact error>" --json
   ```

   Read the JSON:
   - `matched[]` — ranked causes, each with `id`, `title`, `score` (0–100),
     `evidence[]`, and a `fix` (with `fix_id`, `summary`, `commands`, `verify`,
     `notes`, and the `needs_sudo` / `needs_reboot` / `needs_relogin` /
     `auto_applicable` flags). `score >= 75` = high confidence; `50–74` = likely
     (confirm one more piece of evidence with the user first).
   - `out_of_scope` — when set (e.g. WSL2), do **not** diagnose. First, if the
     user's symptom clearly names an app that ships its own runtime (Lemonade,
     Ollama, LM Studio), route them to that app's tracker (see
     [Framework routing](#framework-routing)) — those trackers apply regardless
     of platform. Otherwise relay the `out_of_scope` message and stop (see
     [Out of scope](#out-of-scope)).
   - `route_when_no_match` — when `matched` is empty, hand the user this
     upstream tracker; **do not speculate**. Note the CLI picks this target from
     the *host-detected* framework, not from the symptom text — so for an app
     named only in the symptom, route it yourself per
     [Framework routing](#framework-routing).

2. **Propose the fix.** Show the top match's `title`, `evidence`, plan, and
   `verify` command. Only propose applying it when the user is on board.

3. **Apply with consent.** For an auto-applicable fix:

   ```
   rocm fix <fix-id>            # auto fixes: prompt before changing anything
   rocm fix <fix-id> --dry-run  # show the exact change, touch nothing
   rocm fix <fix-id> --yes      # required to apply in a non-interactive shell
   ```

   Only the four auto-applicable fixes prompt and mutate. The other 11 are
   **print-only** (bootloader, kernel, reinstall, Windows driver, …): `rocm fix
   <id>` just prints the plan for the user to run themselves — no prompt, and the
   CLI never performs those.

4. **Verify.** Have the user run the `verify` command from the diagnosis.

Use `rocm examine` (or `rocm examine --json`) when you only need the host state
(GPU, driver, ROCm install, groups, framework) without a diagnosis.

## Framework routing

`rocm diagnose` covers frameworks that build against the **system** ROCm/HIP:

- **PyTorch**, **llama.cpp** — in scope; diagnose normally.

Apps that ship their **own** ROCm runtime aren't diagnosed here — route the user
to the right tracker. (The CLI's `route_when_no_match` also targets these, but
only when the host probe *detects* that app; when the app is named only in the
symptom, do the routing yourself using the list below.)

- **Lemonade** → https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade/issues
- **Ollama** → https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues
- **LM Studio** → in-app support (no public repo)
- Anything else with no catalog match → ROCm core:
  https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues (this is what `route_when_no_match`
  returns by default).

## Out of scope

- **WSL2** — a distinct platform (`/dev/dxg` + the Windows host driver, not the
  in-tree `amdgpu` module or `/dev/kfd`). `rocm examine`/`diagnose` detect it and
  route out; relay that guidance and point at AMD's ROCm-on-WSL guide.
- **NVIDIA / Intel / Apple Silicon GPUs**, and **fresh installs on a clean
  machine** (a setup task, not a diagnosis). Exit cleanly and say so.

## Rules

- Never run the workflow — or offer *any* troubleshooting, generic GPU fixes
  included — for a non-AMD GPU or a WSL2 setup. State it is out of scope and
  stop.
- Never invent a fix. If `rocm diagnose` returns no match, route upstream.
- Never run a mutating fix without the user's explicit OK; prefer `--dry-run`
  first. New failure modes are added to the CLI catalog, not improvised here.

See [reference.md](reference.md) for the full closed catalog and the CLI
command/exit-code reference.
